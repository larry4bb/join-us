I lost 75% of my savings funds to an online trading scam. I felt so foolish I trusted the wrong investment company. The help arrived in the form of a professional legal team. A friend who has the same similar problem told me that I have a good case and a very high chance of getting my money back from the scammers, she told me to contact wiki support so I decided to try so i contacted them via email, wikihelpdesks@ gmail. com
